# 3. Meeds token – the Work Metaverse currency #

The Work Metaverse is powered by its currency – the Meeds token. Meeds are used to reward users (through engagement programs), purchase in stores, get Deeds, get financial returns on investments etc.

## 3.1. Tokenomics ##

The Meeds maximum supply is limited to 100 million tokens, minted progressively. 5 Million Meeds (5% of total supply) have been pre-minted to date. Among those 5M, 4.5M are locked in a vault contract with a linear vesting over 4 years.
The pre-minted amount was mainly used to acquire software IP, pay for token emission’s legal fees and hosting services. The rest is part of the Meeds DAO funds and will be used to pay for services as well as some launch incentives such as airdrops and referral campaigns.

Meeds are minted at the rate of 10 Meeds per minute. Therefore, the full minting horizon is close to 20 years (as 10*60*24*365 Meeds are minted per year).

## 3.2. Minting allocation ##

Minted Meeds are allocated to encourage involvement of the three categories of stakeholders - the users, the builders and the investors:
- The users (users and Deeds holders/renters) get Meeds through engagement
rewards (mintium model).
- Builders (members of the association and community) get Meeds through the
association funds to build, operate and improve the WoM.
- Investors mint Meeds through renting and buying of liquidity pools and staking
Meeds.

At the beginning, the builders get 30% of the allocation. The 70% are shared between the users and the investors. This allocation proportion will be reviewed on a regular basis, through the Meeds association DAO vote.

## 3.3. Users – minting through engagement ##

Part of the continuously minted Meeds is allocated to the engagement minting channel. The distribution is done weekly. At any given week end, the engagement index is calculated and Deeds can claim their rewards the following week and get their Meeds. Unclaimed Meeds stay in the fund and are added to the next week’s distribution.
The model is described in detail in the previous chapter (part 2.6).

## 3.4. Builders – Meeds association DAO and community of builders ##

The WoM and the Meeds token are operated by the non-profit Meeds Association DAO, introduced above. A multisig contract is used to manage the association operating expenses.

During the minting period, 30% of the minted Meeds are allocated to the Meeds association.

Association members can provide services to the association on the basis of a signed services convention establishing the man-day rate. Services are paid monthly in Meeds, based on the market price. Exemples of services include – enriching the Meeds software, developing the WoM app, developing new connectors, operating the cloud service, providing financial and legal services etc.

Without being a member, any Deed can participate in the creation of a new connector and be rewarded for doing so – first through the Meeds association acquiring the connector and then by minting through this connector.

The association operates a Builders community that welcomes WoM enthusiasts, who want to contribute to the creation of the WoM. The association will sponsor the community out of its budget, compensating the engagement of community members.

Thus, the community will function as an example of a Deed, offering a standard set of services provided by the association. The association stakes Meeds in order to redeem a Deed for the community. The community will then also participate in the engagement minting like any other Deed.

After the minting period is over, the association will be sustained by :
- taxing passive income (3% on Deeds renting)
- taxing selling income (2.5% on Deeds sales)
- perceiving transaction fees over the user of the perks stores
- acting as a liquidity pool provider
- perceiving transaction fees when a Deed distributes non Meeds tokens via WoM
services.
- by operating the Deeds that the association minted over time.
